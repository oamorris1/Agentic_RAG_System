**Introduction:**
The paper discusses the configuration and administration of a Cray CS 400 heterogeneous cluster using Bright Cluster Manager. The focus is on the architecture of the computational environment and the steps taken from the initial assembly of the hardware to the installation of various software layers, including the operating system (OS) and system management tools. Bright Cluster Manager is an enterprise-level software suite that provides comprehensive system management for High Performance Computing (HPC) clusters and Big Data systems.

**High Performance Computing (HPC):**
HPC involves the aggregation of computational elements to implement large-scale, mathematically intensive applications in fields such as engineering, science, mathematics, and business. It is used for modeling complex physical phenomena like climate change, 3-D protein mapping, military applications, and academic research. The industry has turned to accelerators or coprocessing units to enhance the power and efficiency of traditional CPUs. Intel's Xeon Phi Many Integrated Core (MIC) coprocessor is one such accelerator, designed to execute highly parallel, numerically intensive applications efficiently.

**System Environment:**
The Cray CS 400 system used in this research consists of a single head node and six compute nodes.

- **Head Node:** Equipped with an Intel Xeon E5-2650 v3 CPU, Connect-IB (InfiniBand) Single Port QSFP, Fourteen Data Rate (FDR) adapter card, ConnectX-3 EN10GbE Dual-Port SFP+ PCIe3.0 x8 8GT/s Network Interface Card, and an Intel RS2BL08D 8-port SAS RAID controller.
- **Compute Nodes:** Each compute node (node001 â€“ node006) has an Intel Xeon E5-2698 2.3GHz CPU and dual Intel Xeon Phi 7120 passively cooled 1.25 GHz coprocessors. The Xeon Phi 7120 features 61 in-order 64-bit cores, 16GB of GDDR memory, and a Linux-based operating system called uOS. Each core has a 32KB L1 instruction cache, a 32KB L1 data cache, a 512KB L2 cache, and a vector processing unit (VPU) capable of processing 16 single-precision or 8 double-precision floating-point arithmetic operations or 32-bit integers in parallel. Each core supports multithreading with four hardware threads, allowing each compute node to run 488 threads.

**Network Topology:**
The Jackson State University (JSU) cluster is connected via a 10Gb Ethernet network and FDR InfiniBand. The InfiniBand core fabric connects the compute nodes, enabling high-speed data transfer, while the 10Gb and 1Gb switches facilitate network management and remote SSH communication.

**Software Installation:**
The Bright Cluster Manager was installed using the add-on method on a system with Redhat Enterprise Linux Server version 6.5. The installation process involved several steps, including registering with Redhat Network (RHN), configuring repository access, and installing the Bright Cluster Manager package using the bright-installer 7.1.

**Compute Node Image Creation:**
A custom image for the compute nodes was created using the `cm-create-image` command and set as the default image for provisioning. The nodes boot from the network via the 10Gb Ethernet connection.

**Many Platform Software Stack (MPSS):**
The MPSS software required for the Xeon Phi was installed using YUM. The MIC environment variables were added, and the Xeon Phi coprocessors were configured using Bright's MIC configuration tool.

**Module Environment:**
Programs are stored centrally on the head node and accessed using the modules environment software package. The Intel Compiler suite was loaded onto the compute nodes, and the Flexlm license service was started to enable the Intel compiler.

**Intel Compiler:**
The Intel compilers rely on environment variables to function properly. The setup script `compilervars.sh` was executed to configure the Linux runtime environment, and the environment variable `INTEL_LICENSE_FILE` was set to point to the location of the Flexlm license.

**Research:**
The research involved evaluating new approaches in HPC hardware using benchmarking tools and mini-apps. The Mantevo Project developed mini-apps, which are compact self-contained proxies of full-scale applications, to provide reliable and accurate predictors of application and system performance.

**MiniMD Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS):**
MiniMD is a simplified version of the Large-scale Atomic Molecular Massively Parallel Simulator (LAMMPS). It uses spatial decomposition and supports the Lennard-Jones (LJ) inter-atomic potential. MiniMD was ported to the Intel Xeon Phi to analyze and compare its performance with a conventional multicore Xeon CPU.

**Conclusion:**
The paper provides an overview of the process and software used to configure and manage the Cray CS 400 cluster. Bright Cluster Manager worked seamlessly with Intel's software and drivers. Future work will focus on detailing actual cluster performance and improving the installation and administration process.

**Summary:**

The paper by Omar A. Morris and Khalid H. Abed provides a comprehensive guide on configuring and administering a Cray CS 400 heterogeneous cluster using Bright Cluster Manager. The research addresses the increasing complexity and data demands in modern computational models, necessitating powerful hardware and efficient software management.

The Cray CS 400 system used in the study comprises a single head node and six compute nodes, each equipped with Intel Xeon processors and Xeon Phi coprocessors. The head node features an Intel Xeon E5-2650 v3 CPU, InfiniBand adapter, and a 10GbE network interface card. The compute nodes, named node001 to node006, have Intel Xeon E5-2698 CPUs and dual Intel Xeon Phi 7120 coprocessors, capable of running 488 threads each.

The network topology of the Jackson State University (JSU) cluster includes a 10Gb Ethernet network and FDR InfiniBand, facilitating high-speed data transfer and remote SSH communication.

The software installation process involved using Bright Cluster Manager, an enterprise-level software suite for HPC clusters. The recommended method is installing on a bare metal system to avoid configuration errors. The authors describe the add-on installation method they used, which initially led to several mistakes and required starting over. Key lessons learned include the importance of using a package installer and allowing Bright Cluster Manager to override any system conflicts.

The compute nodes receive a software image from the head node, customized with specific software packages. The Many Platform Software Stack (MPSS) is installed for the Xeon Phi coprocessors, and the MIC environment variables are configured using Brightâ€™s MIC configuration tool.

The module environment software package, installed with Bright Cluster Manager, allows programs to be shared across nodes. The Intel compilers rely on environment variables, and the Flexlm license service is started on the head node to enable compiler usage.

For research, the authors used MiniMD, a mini-application from the Mantevo Project, to evaluate the performance of the cluster. MiniMD is a simplified version of the LAMMPS program, designed for ease of porting to new hardware. The research involved executing MiniMD on a conventional Xeon CPU, in native mode on the Xeon Phi coprocessor, and in offload execution mode.

The paper concludes that Bright Cluster Manager worked seamlessly with Intelâ€™s software and drivers. Future work will focus on detailed performance analysis and improving the installation and administration process.

The study highlights the importance of selecting appropriate benchmarking tools and mini-applications for evaluating HPC systems. The Mantevo Projectâ€™s mini-apps, like MiniMD, provide reliable and accurate performance predictions while being easier to understand and deploy than full-scale applications.

Overall, the paper provides valuable insights into the configuration and management of HPC clusters, emphasizing the need for efficient software tools and detailed performance evaluations.
